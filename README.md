# EndInternetCensorship

A new proxy site that builds on [Degeneracy](https://github.com/Degen-dev/Degeneracy)

Old Replit Demo: https://home.endinternetcensorship.repl.co/ (*The old replit demo is not based on Degeneracy*)

Does Your School Try To Censor Your Internet Access?<br>
Well, Mine Does And I Decided To Do Something About It!<br>
This Site Can Easily Be Moved And Stays Unblocked,<br>
While Receiving New Updates Now & Then!

⚠️ Do **not** try to deploy anything. The code on github is unfinished, just use the old replit demo for now.
